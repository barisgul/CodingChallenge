# CodingChallenge

All of my solutions from Hackerrank and Codility programming chalannges. 
- Each question has an original link of question and pdf document as well.

If you want to test it, clone the repository and call question method. 
For examplei if you want to solve strong password question (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/strong-password/problem) you can use # Example Caller From Main # region from https://github.com/barisgul/CodingChallenge/blob/a3bf121de5c0a874d6436c678b00074b84d6c7c6/Hackerrank/Algorithms/Strings/StrongPassword.cs#L5 and paste it your Main method in Program.Cs
