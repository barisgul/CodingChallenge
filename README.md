# CodingChallenge

- This project contaions my solutions from Hackerrank and Codility programming chalannges. 
- it does not include the most optimized solutions, it includes my solutions. I will keep adding as I solve the questions.
- Each question has an original link of question and pdf document as well.<br>
For example, StringPassword soution also contaions its explanation as pdf at https://github.com/barisgul/CodingChallenge/tree/master/Hackerrank/Algorithms/Strings 

- If you want to test it, clone the repository and call question method. 
- For examplei if you want to solve strong password question (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/strong-password/problem) you can use **Example Caller From Main**  region from https://github.com/barisgul/CodingChallenge/blob/a3bf121de5c0a874d6436c678b00074b84d6c7c6/Hackerrank/Algorithms/Strings/StrongPassword.cs#L5 and paste it your Main method in Program.Cs
